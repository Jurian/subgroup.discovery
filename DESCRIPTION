Description: Developed to assist in discovering interesting subgroups in high-dimensional data. 
  The PRIM implementation is based on the 1998 paper "Bump hunting in high-dimensional data" by Jerome H. Friedman and Nicholas I. Fisher <doi:10.1023/A:1008894516817>.
  PRIM involves finding a set of "rules" which combined imply unusually large values of some other target variable. 
  Specifically one tries to find a set of sub regions in which the target variable is substantially larger than overall mean. 
  The objective of bump hunting in general is to find regions in the input (attribute/feature) space with relatively high values for the target variable. 
  The regions are described by simple rules of the type if: condition-1 and ... and condition-n then: estimated target value. Given the data (or a subset of the data), 
  the goal is to produce a box B within which the target mean is as large as possible.
